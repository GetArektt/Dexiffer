Software to show photographers their equipment info

Ever wondered how many photos do you take with each lens?
This program helps you show the exact statistic of the number of photos taken with a particular device in a pleasant to the eye bar. Easy to use, easy to view.

Currently keeping statistics of:
manufacturer
device
Lens
the program with which the photo was processed
ISO, resolution

In future releases planning to add a percentage of the number of photos cropped.

Later I will try to write a program helping delete vulnerable exif information to protect privacy. Ever wondered how many incidents happened due to not deleted GPS location of the photo.
